    <h1>Explore New York City</h1>
    <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-transform: capitalize;
    text-size-adjust: 2px;">New York City is on one of the world's largest natural harbors. It is made up of five boroughs, each of which is a county of the state of New York.[9] The five boroughs—Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, the Bronx, and Staten Island—were combined into one city in 1898.[10] The city and its metropolitan area are an important place for legal immigration to the United States. As many as 800 languages are spoken in New York,[11] making it the most linguistically diverse city in the world. New York has more than 3.2 million people born outside the United States,[12] the biggest foreign-born population of any city in the world as of 2016.</p>
